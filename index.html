            <p>Hey there, been a bit huh? I noticed you trying to reach out at the end of last year. I wasn‚Äôt really sure what to make of it at the time. So I guess that‚Äôs why it has taken me so long to respond, and to be honest I wasn‚Äôt even sure if I wanted to.</p>
            <p>I can tell you didn‚Äôt like how things ended between us, as much as I did. I know I sort of vanished, but I don‚Äôt really regret doing that. There was a lot going through my head at the time, that was too hard for me to talk about with you.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="book-page right">
            <p>It seemed best for me to stop trying to pursue a relationship with you. Even though I still wanted to be friends and keep contact, it was too hard for me to see you move away with someone else. So I did what I did to move on because I didn‚Äôt want to live my life through your eyes.</p>
            <p>I‚Äôve changed a lot since then, but still feel like the same person. Part of me still wants to give it a try with you. Or even be friends because it was hard letting you go. I really did just want to be best friends with you. And I hope you feel the same.</p>

            <p>I think that playlist is for me right? If it isn‚Äôt ‚Äî fuck this is so awkward haha ‚Äî but I'm confident it is. I was originally just going to make you a playlist to respond to yours, but I‚Äôm weird and it felt too easy and I wanted more of a challenge I guess.</p>
            <p>I remember sending pictures to each other through our Spotify playlists and found it really sweet. Spotify didn‚Äôt save any of the pictures so that‚Äôs kind of why I made this website. If we do start talking again, I thought it would be nice to look back on the pictures we send.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="book-page right">
            <p>(I‚Äôm not sure how you feel about that, if you don‚Äôt like the idea of them being saved that‚Äôs cool ‚Äî I can find another use for this website lol). But I mostly wanted to make this website to just do more on my part and I guess show that I never wanted to lose you.</p>
            <p>If you still want to reach out again, whenever you're ready, you can upload a picture to that playlist you made ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è‚Äù and it will show on the website.</p>
            <p>(I got hella deja vu writing this btw ü•∏)</p>
